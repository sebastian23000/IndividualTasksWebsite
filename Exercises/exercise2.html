				<dt> Why there are no classes in JavaScript? </dt>
				<dd>
					I think it's weird that JavaScript is object oriented while not having classes. I know that JavaScript fills its object orientation using object notations, but I think they don't replace classes fully. Why doesn't JavaScript have classes?
